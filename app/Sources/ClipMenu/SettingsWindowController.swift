// ClipMenu is an LSUIElement agent, so the SwiftUI `Settings` scene can't be
// opened programmatically; DragonKit's `DragonSettingsWindowController` owns a
// reliable self-managed window instead (flips the app to `.regular` while it's
// open so it can become key, back to `.accessory` on close). The pane list is
// data-driven (`SettingsPane` conformers → `SettingsShell`), selection is
// host-owned so menu items can open a specific pane ("About ClipMenu 2" →
// About; "Uninstall…" → Uninstall), and the root re-localizes live via
// `.dragonLocalized()` — mirroring dragon-kit's Example app wiring.
