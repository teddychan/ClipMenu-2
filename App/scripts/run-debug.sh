# Build + launch a LOCAL DEBUG build of ClipMenu with its OWN identity so it runs
# safely NEXT TO the installed release. Per dragon-mac-ops "Test / debug builds":
# the debug build gets bundle id com.dragonapp.clipmenu-2.debug and the name
# "ClipMenu 2 Debug", so it has its own TCC entry + UserDefaults domain and never
# fights the installed app's menu-bar/login-item instance.
#
# (clipmenu-2 is SwiftPM, not Xcode, so this adapts the skill's xcodebuild template
# to `swift build` + the same .app assembly as scripts/run.sh.)

# Usage:  ./scripts/run-debug.sh

# updater stays inert on the Debug channel; see UpdaterUI.isSupported and the
