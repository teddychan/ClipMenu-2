    /// its source. DragonKit tried the same reasoning and retracted it (dragon-kit #63); ClipMenu's
    /// own `LICENSE` names two holders outright, so the app's notices contradicted it. What
    /// CONFORMANCE §R14 actually fixes is a row in a settings pane, and it leaves `LICENSE`,
    /// `NSHumanReadableCopyright` and the licences page alone.

    /// argument that settled this row settles it. `LICENSE` is where the MIT grant lives and it
    /// still names both holders; the upstream project is credited by `originalWork` below.

    /// Baird's actual source under GPL-3.0 — where ClipMenu 2 reuses none of Naotaka Morimoto's —
    /// and it kept both holders in its plist on the reasoning that §4 makes that key the binary's
    /// notice. §4 is really carried by its `LICENSE` and bundled acknowledgements, both of which
    /// still name him; an optional display key was never what discharged it.
